During several challenges you will build an Electronic Life simulation based on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life' target='_blank'>Conway's Game of Life</a>.

The simulation will be very simple only having a wall, plant, and animal.


You will be building a very simple javascript object for use with the animateworld.js javascript written for Eloquent Javascript.
