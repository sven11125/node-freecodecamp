<h2>Web Storage API</h2>

<p>The
	<a href="http://brickhousecodecamp.org/docs/javascript/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API.html">
		<strong>Web Storage API</strong>
	</a>
	provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.</p>

<p>The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>sessionStorage</code> maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long
		as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</li>
	<li>
		<code>localStorage</code> does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Web Storage API extends the
		<code>Window</code>
	 object with two properties â€”
	 <code>Window.sessionStorage</code> and
	 <code>Window.localStorage</code>.  These two objects implement the
	 <code>Storage</code> interface.  There is also a
	 <code>Window.onstorage</code> event handler that fires when a storage area changes.</p>

<p>There are also alias' for these objects globally as sessionStorage and localStorage.</p>
<p>For these challenges we will focus only on localStorage.</p>
