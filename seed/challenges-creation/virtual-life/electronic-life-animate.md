# Electronic Life (Animate)

* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* DOM Elements
* DOM Events
* ES6 Modules

## Specification

* Create an object that will build, using the DOM, an HTML interface for your previously built Electronic Life World object
* In this object set a timed heartbeat that will call your World object's turn() function to advance the game
* After calling turn() call your World object's toString() function to get the data, the current state of the game, as a string
* With the data, build an HTML user interface, using the DOM, to represent the data
* Do not modify your World object from the previous project
* Use only the turn() and toString() functions on your World object, do not access any World variables or other functions
* Generate HTML, using the DOM, that will create a cell for each world item
* Color the cell uniquely for each world item type (wall, plant, etc), do not display text
* You may get ideas from eloquent javascript but do not take his approach
