# Commitment to not solve other students problems

* Computer programming requires excellent problem solving skills.
* Working through problems with the help of documentation is a daily activity for all programmers.
* When students give help it should only be to point out where in the documentation, books or other materials where they can learn about a concept.
* Students should never give away a solution to a problem or share code that completes a problem.
* If a student is still unable to solve a problem, please, refer them to the tutor.
* If you and the other student(s) have finished and passed off the project or challenge feel free to discuss, share techniques and source code.
* However, please do not discuss within earshot of other students that have not passed off to that point.
* Please commit to not solve other students problems, share code or give away answers.
